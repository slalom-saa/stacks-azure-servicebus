# Slalom Stacks

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6nb0ud2cpm4rkuyx/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/slalom-saa/stacks/branch/master)   [![NuGet Version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Slalom.Stacks.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Slalom.Stacks/)

Stacks simplifies complex service development by leveraging existing frameworks and providing an easy to 
learn, cross-framework service model.  The same code can run in multiple contexts with just a 
few lines and can run at web scale.  The common model simplifies the validation, reporting, integration and discovery of those services – in many cases it is baked in.
